[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/OpenXmlDev/ts-oxpt/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=43I75GLRHM)](https://codecov.io/gh/OpenXmlDev/ts-oxpt)

This repository contains NPM packages written in TypeScript that provide functionality
similar to the Open XML PowerTools written in C#.

An important use case for the Open XML PowerTools for TypeScript are Office Add-ins
(see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/) written in TypeScript.

For starters, the first package, `@openxmldev/linq-to-xml`, provides key features of
Linq to XML for TypeScript. It is currently under development and, therefore, not yet
published as an NPM package.
